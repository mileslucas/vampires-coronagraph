Sensitivity will be limited by focal plane speckles from residual, uncorrected wave-front errors, so it is important to characterize remnant coronagraphic speckles. A general analysis is presented, illustrated with the classical Lyot coronagraph and the newer four quadrant phase mask scheme. Two kinds of remnant speckles, of distinct symmetry, occur that are closely analogous to those arising in direct imaging at high correction. Properties and typical intensity estimates are presented, which are useful for estimating speckle noise and false companion detection levels and reduction strategies. For realistic parameters describing some current ground-based observations, the novel antisymmetric ``pinned'' speckles, usually neglected even in direct imaging, are nonnegligible in narrowband short exposures. For parameters appropriate to a space-borne coronagraph on the Hubble Space Telescope, these anomalous speckles are in fact dominant close to the star and thus a potentially significant source of false companion detections.},

Direct imaging of nearby exoplanets and the circumstellar disks in which they form and evolve is challenging due to the high contrast ratio and small angular separation relative to the central star. Exoplanets are typically within 1 arcsec of, and between 4 and 10 orders of magnitude fainter than, the stars they orbit. To meet these challenges, ground-based telescopes must be equipped with extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems optimized to acquire high-contrast images of the immediate surrounding of nearby bright stars. Current ExAO systems have the sensitivity to image thermal emission from young massive planets in near-IR, while future systems deployed on Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will image starlight reflected by lower-mass rocky planets. Thanks to rapid progress in optical coronagraphy, wavefront control, and data analysis techniques, direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of habitable exoplanets will be within reach of the next generation of large ground-based telescopes.},

We also develop a linear algebra based model of coronagraphy that can both explain the behavior of existing coronagraphs and quantify the coronagraphic performance limit imposed by fundamental physics. We find that the maximum theoretical throughput of a coronagraph is equal to 1 minus the nonaberrated noncoronagraphic PSF of the telescope. We describe how a coronagraph reaching this fundamental limit may be designed, and how much improvement over the best existing coronagraph design is still possible. Both the analytical model and numerical simulations of existing designs also show that this theoretical limit rapidly degrades as the source size is increased: the ``highest performance'' coronagraphs, those with the highest throughput and smallest inner working angle (IWA), are the most sensitive to stellar angular diameter. This unfortunately rules out the possibility of using a small IWA ({$<\lambda$}/d) coronagraph for a terrestrial planet imaging mission. Finally, a detailed numerical simulation that accurately accounts for stellar angular size, zodiacal and exozodiacal light is used to quantify the efficiency of coronagraph designs for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets in a possible real observing program. We find that in the photon noise-limited regime, a 4 m telescope with a theoretically optimal coronagraph is able to detect Earth-like planets around 50 stars with 1 hr exposure time per target (assuming 25\% throughput and exozodi levels similar to our solar system). We also show that at least two existing coronagraph design can approach this level of performance in the ideal monochromatic case considered in this study.},

  abstract = {Context. A vortex coronagraph is now available for high contrast observations with the Keck/NIRC2 instrument at L band. The vortex coronagraph uses a vortex phase mask in a focal plane and a Lyot stop in a downstream pupil plane to provide high contrast at small angular separations from the observed host star. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Reaching the optimal performance of the coronagraph requires fine control of the wavefront incident on the phase mask. In particular, centering errors can lead to significant stellar light leakage that degrades the contrast performance and prevents the observation of faint planetary companions around the observed stars. It is thus critical to correct for the possible slow drift of the star image from the phase mask center, generally due to mechanical flexures induced by temperature and/or gravity field variation, or to misalignment between the optics that rotate in pupil tracking mode. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: A control loop based on the QACITS algorithm for the vortex coronagraph has been developed and deployed for the Keck/NIRC2 instrument. This algorithm executes the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, initial centering of the star on the vortex center, and stabilisation during the acquisition of science frames. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: On-sky data show that the QACITS control loop stabilizes the position of the star image down to 2.4 mas rms at a frequency of about 0.02 Hz. However, the accuracy of the estimator is probably limited by a systematic error due to a misalignment of the Lyot stop with respect to the entrance pupil, estimated to be on the order of 4.5 mas. A method to reduce the amplitude of this bias down to 1 mas is proposed. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The QACITS control loop has been successfully implemented and provides a robust method to center and stabilize the star image on the vortex mask. In addition, QACITS ensures a repeatable pointing quality and significantly improves the observing efficiency compared to manual operations. It is now routinely used for vortex coronagraph observations at Keck/NIRC2, providing contrast and angular resolution capabilities suited for exoplanet and disk imaging.},

The well corrected NIR (y-K bands) wavefronts can then be injected into any of the available coronagraphs, including but not limited to the phase induced amplitude apodization and the vector vortex coronagraphs, both of which offer an inner working angle as low as 1 lambda/D. Non-common path, low-order aberrations are sensed with a coronagraphic low-order wavefront sensor in the infrared (IR). Low noise, high frame rate, NIR detectors allow for active speckle nulling and coherent differential imaging, while the HAWAII 2RG detector in the HiCIAO imager and/or the CHARIS integral field spectrograph (from mid 2016) can take deeper exposures and/or perform angular, spectral and polarimetric differential imaging. Science in the visible is provided by two interferometric modules: VAMPIRES and FIRST, which enable sub-diffraction limited imaging in the visible region with polarimetric and spectroscopic capabilities respectively. We describe the instrument in detail and present preliminary results both on-sky and in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding confidence levels (CLs) in high contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly towards small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically affects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at fixed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases towards very small inner working angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be significantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis which ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical effect has a significant impact on current coronagraphic and future high contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys.},

We measured the FWHM and Strehl ratio of stellar images in globular clusters and found that the isoplanatic angle is approximately 30 arcsec.

However, imaging the innermost region of such discs (a zone critical to planet formation) is challenging for traditional observational techniques (such as near-IR imaging and coronagraphy) due to the relatively long wavelengths involved and the area occulted by the coronagraphic mask. Here, we introduce a new instrument - Visible Aperture-Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) - which combines non-redundant aperture-masking interferometry with differential polarimetry to directly image this previously inaccessible innermost region. By using the polarization of light scattered by dust in the disc to provide precise differential calibration of interferometric visibilities and closure phases, VAMPIRES allows direct imaging at and beyond the telescope diffraction limit. Integrated into the SCExAO (Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics) system at the Subaru telescope, VAMPIRES operates at visible wavelengths (where polarization is high) while allowing simultaneous infrared observations conducted by HICIAO. Here, we describe the instrumental design and unique observing technique and present the results of the first on-sky commissioning observations, validating the excellent visibility and closure-phase precision which are then used to project expected science performance metrics.},

Whether it's understanding the process of planetary formation in a star's early years, or uncovering the cause of the enormous mass-loss that takes place during a star's dying moments, a key to scientific understanding lies in the inner few AU of the circumstellar environment. Corresponding to scales of 10s of milli-arcseconds, these observations pose a huge technical challenge due to the high angular-resolutions and contrasts required. A major stumbling block is the problem of the Earth's own atmospheric turbulence. The other difficulty is that precise calibration is required to combat the extremely high contrast ratios and high resolutions faced. By taking advantage of the fact that starlight scattered by dust in the circumstellar region is polarized, differential polarimetry can help achieve this calibration. Spectral features can also be utilized.},

SPHERE has been successfully integrated and tested in Europe end 2013 and has been re-integrated at Paranal in Chile early 2014 for a first light at the beginning of May. The heart of the SPHERE instrument is its eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) SAXO (SPHERE AO for eXoplanet Observation) subsystem that provides extremely high correction of turbulence and very accurate stabilization of images for coronagraphic purpose. However, SAXO, as well as the overall instrument, must also provide constant operability overnights, ensuring robustness and autonomy. An original control scheme has been developed to satisfy this challenging dichotomy. It includes in particular both an Optimized Modal Gain Integrator (OMGI) to control the Deformable Mirror (DM) and a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control law to manage the tip-tilt (TT) mirror. LQG allows optimal estimation and prediction of turbulent angle of arrival but also of possible vibrations. A specific and unprecedented control scheme has been developed to continuously adapt and optimize LQG control ensuring a constant match to turbulence and vibrations characteristics. SPHERE is thus the first operational system implementing LQG, with automatic adjustment of its models. SAXO has demonstrated performance beyond expectations during tests in Europe, in spite of internal limitations. Very first results have been obtained on sky last May. We thus come back to SAXO control scheme, focusing in particular on the LQG based TT control and the various upgrades that have been made to enhance further the performance ensuring constant operability and robustness. We finally propose performance assessment based on in lab performance and first on sky results and discuss further possible improvements.},

In this way a Propagator acts as any physical part of the optical system, be it a piece of free space, a thin complex apodizer or a microlens array. HCIPy contains Fraunhofer and Fresnel propagators through free space.

Included in HCIPy are wavefront errors (modal, power spectra), complex apertures (VLT, Keck or Subaru pupil), coronagraphs (Lyot, vortex or apodizing phase plate coronagraph), deformable mirrors, wavefront sensors (Shack-Hartmann, Pyramid, Zernike or phase-diversity wavefront sensor) and multi-layer atmospheric models including scintillation). HCIPy aims to provide an easy-to-use, modular framework for wavefront control and coronagraphy on current and future telescopes, enabling rapid prototyping of the full high-contrast imaging system.

  abstract = {A renewal of interest into Lyot coronagraphy began about 10 years ago with the advent of the new and very demanding goal of detecting directly extrasolar planets. Among the new ideas, the Four Quadrant Phase Mask (4QPMC) has been rather prolific. The 4QPM coronagraph is based the peculiar design of binary phase mask (0,{$\pi$}) dividing the full field of view at the focal plane in four quadrants. The mutual destructive interferences of the coherent light of a source perfectly centered on the mask, produce a total nulling within the pupil image, as is demonstrated analytically. We first recall the concept and performance of the 4QPMC. We then analyse the different limitations in space or ground-based observations from simulations. We then address the issue of device manufacturing and give the status of the actual performance in laboratory. A section reviews the various instruments under development that are equipped with this component. We conclude with a panorama of the rest of the family of the 4QPMC, which comprises several variants proposed by different teams. More specifically we address the important question of the achromatization by describing the various ideas which are currently explored to solve this problem. Among them, some genuine ones, not yet published, are presented. To cite this article: D. Rouan et al., C. R. Physique 8 (2007).

  abstract = {Photometric and astrometric calibration of high-contrast images is essential for the characterization of companions at small angular separation from their stellar host. The main challenge to performing accurate relative photometry and astrometry of high-contrast companions with respect to the host star is that the central starlight cannot be directly used as a reference, as it is either blocked by a coronagraphic mask or saturating the detector. Our approach is to add fiducial incoherent faint copies of the host star in the image plane and alternate the pattern of these copies between exposures. Subtracting two frames with different calibration patterns removes measurement bias due to static and slowly varying incoherent speckle halo components, while ensuring that calibration references are inserted on each frame. Each calibration pattern is achieved by high-speed modulation of a pupil-plane deformable mirror to ensure incoherence. We implemented the technique on-sky on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument with speckles which were of the order of 103 times fainter than the central host. The achieved relative photometric and astrometric measurement precisions for 10 s exposure were respectively 5\% and 20 milliarcsecond. We also demonstrate, over a 540 s measurement span, that residual photometric and astrometric errors are uncorrelated in time, indicating that residual noise averages as the inverse square root of the number of exposures in longer time-series data sets.},

The sources of speckles are a combination of atmospheric residuals and aberrations in the non-common path.

The proposed method directly addresses the challenge of compensating the NCPA. The algorithm DrWHO - Direct Reinforcement Wavefront Heuristic Optimisation - is a quasi-real-time compensation of static and dynamic NCPA for boosting image contrast. It is an image-based lucky imaging approach, aimed at finding and continuously updating the ideal reference of the wavefront sensor (WFS) that includes the NCPA, and updating this new reference to the WFS. Doing so changes the point of convergence of the AO loop. We show here the first results of a post-coronagraphic application of DrWHO. DrWHO does not rely on any model nor requires accurate wavefront sensor calibration, and is applicable to non-linear wavefront sensing situations. We present on-sky performances using a pyramid WFS sensor with the Subaru coronagraph extreme AO (SCExAO) instrument.},

NCPAs are not seen by the wavefront sensor (WFS) of the adaptive optics (AO) loop, hence the difficulty in correcting them. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We propose to improve the identification and rejection of slow and static speckles in AO-corrected images. The algorithm known as the Direct Reinforcement Wavefront Heuristic Optimisation (DrWHO) performs a frequent compensation operation on static and quasi-static aberrations (including NCPAs) to boost image contrast. It is applicable to general-purpose AO systems as well as HCI systems. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: By changing the WFS reference at every iteration of the algorithm (a few tens of seconds), DrWHO changes the AO system point of convergence to lead it towards a compensation mechanism for the static and slow aberrations. References are calculated using an iterative lucky-imaging approach, where each iteration updates the WFS reference, ultimately favoring high-quality focal plane images. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We validated this concept through both numerical simulations and on-sky testing on the SCExAO instrument at the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. Simulations show a rapid convergence towards the correction of 82\% of the NCPAs. On-sky tests were performed over a 10 min run in the visible (750 nm). We introduced a flux concentration (FC) metric to quantify the point spread function (PSF) quality and measure a 15.7\% improvement compared to the pre-DrWHO image. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The DrWHO algorithm is a robust focal-plane wavefront sensing calibration method that has been successfully demonstrated on-sky. It does not rely on a model and does not require wavefront sensor calibration or linearity. It is compatible with different wavefront control methods, and can be further optimized for speed and efficiency. The algorithm is ready to be incorporated in scientific observations, enabling better PSF quality and stability during observations.},

  abstract = {A direct image of an exoplanet system is a snapshot of the planets and disk around a central star. We can estimate the orbit of a planet from a time series of images, and we can estimate the size, temperature, clouds, atmospheric gases, surface properties, rotation rate, and likelihood of life on a planet from its photometry, colors, and spectra in the visible and infrared. The exoplanets around stars in the solar neighborhood are expected to be bright enough for us to characterize them with direct imaging; however, they are much fainter than their parent star, and separated by very small angles, so conventional imaging techniques are totally inadequate, and new methods are needed. A direct-imaging instrument for exoplanets must (1) suppress the bright star's image and diffraction pattern, and (2) suppress the star's scattered light from imperfections in the telescope. This chapter shows how exoplanets can be imaged by controlling diffraction with a coronagraph or interferometer, and controlling scattered light with deformable mirrors.},

This analytical approximation to the point spread function (PSF) is shown to provide the best fit to the PSF predicted from atmospheric turbulence theory when {$\beta\sptilde$}4.765. The Moffat PSF is additionally shown to contain the Gaussian PSF as a limiting case ({$\beta$}-{$>\infty$}). The Moffat function is also shown to be numerically well behaved when modelling narrow PSFs in HST images. Seeing effects are computed for elliptically symmetric surface brightness distributions. The widely used assumption of circular symmetry when studying the effects of seeing on intrinsically elliptical sources is shown to produce significant discrepancies with respect to the true effects of seeing on these sources. A prescription to correct raw (observed) central intensities, effective radii, index n and mean effective surface brightness is given.},

Our adaptive optics correction at optical wavelengths in combination with (double) spectral differential imaging (SDI) and angular differential imaging (ADI) was capable of resolving a ring feature around omi Cet and detect the H{$\alpha$} counterpart of jet around RY Tau. We tested the post-processing by changing the order of ADI and SDI and both of the contrast limits achieved {$\sim$}10 - 3 to 5 \texttimes{} 10 - 4 at 0.3{${''}$}, which is comparable to other H{$\alpha$} high-contrast imaging instruments in the Southern Hemisphere such as very large telescope (VLT)/spectro-polarimetric high-contrast exoplanet research, VLT/MUSE, and Magellan AO. Current wavefront sensing and adaptive optics correction at optical wavelengths empirically depend on airmass, and Subaru/VAMPIRES provide great opportunities for H{$\alpha$} high-contrast imaging for Northern Hemisphere targets.},

  abstract = {Focal plane wavefront sensing is an elegant solution for wavefront sensing since near-focal images of any source taken by a detector show distortions in the presence of aberrations. Non-Common Path Aberrations and the Low Wind Effect both have the ability to limit the achievable contrast of the finest coronagraphs coupled with the best extreme adaptive optics systems. To correct for these aberrations, the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument hosts many focal plane wavefront sensors using detectors as close to the science detector as possible. We present seven of them and compare their implementation and efficiency on SCExAO. This work will be critical for wavefront sensing on next generation of extremely large telescopes that might present similar limitations.},
